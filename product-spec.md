## Overview

The Mid Ohio Foodbank has data on both Food Pantries and users of Food Pantries. The Mid Ohio Foodbank wants to open the Food Pantry data to third party developers to allow them to develop user-facing applications. There is currently no good way for developers to consume data from the Mid Ohio Foodbank. It is believed that by creating easy ways to consume Mid Ohio Foodbank's data, that it will unleash new and interesting ideas/ways for the Mid Ohio Foodbank to help serve it's customers.

The goal of this project is create a developer-facing process to easily consume Food Pantry data, starting with Mid Ohio Foodbank's use case, and create documentation/examples of using the consumption to further reduce the barriers to entry for developers.

Food pantries service customers based on zip code. If you are from a certain zip code, you must go to a certain set of food pantries.

## Future Iterations

## Requirements

1. The API project shall provide a method to query all Food Pantry information out.
2. The API project shall provide a method to query food pantries by zip code that they serve.
3. THe API project shall provide a method to find out the hours food pantries are open.
4. THe API project shall provide a method to find out the address of food pantries.
5. The API project shall create documentation showing how to get access to the data in the following programing languages:

- Python
- Java
- JavaScript

6. The API project shall provide the data in JSON form, as it is currently the easiest cross-language way to consume data.


## Assumptions

- All abuse/throttling concerns will eventually be handled by the Smart Columbus Project and will not be handled by this project.
- There is no requirement for security/vetting of developers since the data is already open

## Users

The users of the API project are developers.

## Open Questions

## Approach

The API project will start with a miniminally viable product, leveraging the skillsets that the project developers already know. This will ensure that something of value is created as quickly as possible without getting mired down in creating the prefect solution.

## Timeline

Useable Product and Technical Specifications are to be completed by 14 August.
